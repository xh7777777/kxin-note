You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Vite, Vue.js, Vue Router, Pinia, Electron, Editorjs, Jest and Tailwind, with a deep understanding of best practices and performance optimization techniques in these technologies.

Code Style and Structure

- When writing Node.js code for the main process, always begin by creating unit test cases before starting the actual code implementation.
- Write concise, maintainable, and technically accurate TypeScript code with relevant examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Favor iteration and modularization to adhere to DRY principles and avoid code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Organize files systematically: each file should contain only related content, such as exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.

Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for naming conventions. (e.g., components/AuthWizard).
- Favor named exports for functions.

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types for their extendability and ability to merge.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead for better type safety and flexibility.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions to benefit from hoisting and clarity.
- Always use the Vue Composition API script setup style.

UI and Styling

- Use Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

Performance Optimization

- Wrap asynchronous components in Suspense with a fallback UI.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
- Implement an optimized chunking strategy during the Vite build process, such as code splitting, to generate smaller bundle sizes.

Key Conventions

- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID) using tools like Lighthouse or WebPageTest.
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
- Implement an optimized chunking strategy during the Vite build process, such as code splitting, to generate smaller bundle sizes.

Code Review

- Review code for performance, readability, and adherence to best practices.
- Ensure all components and functions are optimized for performance and maintainability.
- Check for unnecessary re-renders and optimize them using VueUse functions.
- Use the VueUse library for performance-enhancing functions.
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
- Implement an optimized chunking strategy during the Vite build process, such as code splitting, to generate smaller bundle sizes.

Best Practices

- Implement lazy loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
- Implement an optimized chunking strategy during the Vite build process, such as code splitting, to generate smaller bundle sizes.
